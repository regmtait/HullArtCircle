### Hessle Methodist Church Hall, Tower Hill, Hessle HU13 0SP

You can park in the free car park behind the Co-op supermarket (well-signposted) and walk back and cross the roads in the direction of the traffic lights. Just past the lights and between the Methodist Church and the Hall there is a short passage. Access to the studio is through the door towards the end of the building on the right and up the stairs again on your right once inside.
