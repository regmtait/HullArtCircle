HULL ART CIRCLE was [formed in 1966](/history/ 'Origins of the Hull Art Circle') with the object of providing a well equipped studio, heated and with adequate lighting, where artists could meet, work and leave their materials.

[We meet weekly](/meetings/ 'Weekly meetings') on a Monday evening at our studio in the Civil Hall in Cottingham. We’re well equipped with easels and donkeys. 

Although no tuition is offered, members are willing to give advice and help. We welcome [new members](/join/ 'Join Hull Art Circle') at all levels.
