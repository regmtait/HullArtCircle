HULL ART CIRCLE was [formed in 1966](/history/ 'Origins of the Hull Art Circle') with the object of providing a well equipped studio, heated and with adequate lighting, where artists could meet, work and leave their materials.

[We meet twice weekly](/meetings/ 'Twice weekly meetings'), on a Monday and Wednesday evening. Our studios are at the Civil Hall in Cottingham and the Methodist Church Hall in Hessle. Weâ€™re well equipped with easels and donkeys. 

Although no tuition is offered, members are willing to give advice and help. We welcome [new members](/join/ 'Join Hull Art Circle') at all levels.
