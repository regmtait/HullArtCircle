We have started to arrange sketching around Hull to record Hull City of Culture. If you are interested let us know or just turn up. These sessions are not just for the Hull Art Circle group, so if you would like to sketch with us, please come along.

## Next meeting

Meet &amp; Sketch at The Maritime Museum, Thursday 12th October, 10.30am.

Opening this week is the [Turner and the Whale](http://search3.openobjects.com/kb5/hull/events/event.page?record=LKXJjaHaX9U) exhibition. A chance to see four of Turner's paintings at the Maritime Museum.
