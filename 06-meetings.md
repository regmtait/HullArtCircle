### Evening meetings

We meet at our studio every Monday evening. We offer no tuition, but we always have a portrait model and occasionally a life model.

* Monday at Cottingham: 6:30—8:30pm — ([details](/contact/))

### Programme

* Meetings are on Monday evenings
* Annual [exhibitions](/exhibitions/)

### Periods of closure

The studio is closed during term time holidays. During August we sometimes find alternative accommodation for a few weeks.
