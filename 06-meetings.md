### Evening meetings

We meet at our studios every Monday and Wednesday evening. We offer no tuition, but we always have a portrait model, and occasionally, once a month a life model.

* Monday and Wednesday at Hessle: 6:45—8:45pm

### Daytime meetings — open all all

We also have a daytime life drawing session, again once a month. This morning session (10:30am—12:30pm) is open to non-members. There is an additional cost of £5 per session to cover the room hire.

### Studio locations

We meet at the Methodist Church Hall in Hessle — ([details](/contact/))
