### Evening meetings

We meet at our studios every Monday and Wednesday evening. We offer no tuition, but we always have a portrait model, and occasionally, once a month a life model.

* Monday at Endeavour: 6:15—8:15pm
* Wednesday at Hessle: 6:45—8:45pm

### Daytime meetings — open all all

We also have a daytime life drawing session, again once a month. This morning session (10:30am—12:30pm) is open to non-members. There is an additional cost of £5 per session to cover the room hire.

### Studio locations

We meet at two different locations—the old Endeavour High School on Beverley Road for Monday evenings, and the Methodist Church Hall in Hessle each Wednesday ([details](/contact/))

### Model fees

Paid models are £1.50 per session, or £2.00 for a life model. (Volunteers are very welcome too. Please [get in touch](/contact/) if you'd like to sit for us).

### Programme

* Meetings are on Monday and Wednesday evenings
* Monthly daytime sessions on a Tuesday (10:30am—12:30pm)
* Annual [exhibitions](/exhibitions/)
* Christmas party
* Sketching programme during the summer while the studio is closed

### Periods of closure

The studio is closed during term time holidays. During August we sometimes find alternative accommodation for a few weeks.
