### COVID precautions

We ask people attending the Cottingham venue to wear a mask when entering the building and if walking about talking. You can remove the mask when sitting and drawing.

Many of our members are vulnerable to infection and the room is getting crowded as more members begin to attend. 

We ask that only people who have had the COVID vaccination to attend.
